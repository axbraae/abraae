My personal [website](https://abraae.netlify.app/). Written in R using the `blogdown` package to build a Hugo website.

I set up this site following the excellent tutorial by [Alison Hill](https://alison.rbind.io/blog/2020-12-new-year-new-blogdown/), supplementing with information from [blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) and [Wowchemy](https://wowchemy.com/docs/getting-started/customization/) itself as the structure of their Academic Hugo website template has changed a little since Alison's tutorial.

Currently still a work in progress.
